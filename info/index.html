					<h2>Lone Hawk Farm</h2>
					<p>10790 North 49th Street</p>
					<p>Longmont, Colorado</p>
					<p>Located outside Longmont our beautiful venue has picturesque views, a wonderful lawn for our ceremony, and a architectural barn for dancing and dinner.</p>
                    <p>We recommend car pooling if you can. Parking is past the barn in the field. Follow the long, windy driveway all the way to the end to find the field.</p>

                    <h2>The Day Of</h2>
                    <p>The ceremony is scheduled for 2:00. We don't know how long it will be yet, but we are planning to be outside. You are welcome to where a hat or just wear sunscreen and dress accordingly. If the weather decides that Memorial Day seems like a good day for rain or snow, we can move into the barn (which is heated ^_^)</p>
                    <p>The reception will follow the ceremony in the barn. Food will be served, drinks will be opened, and we will take part in celebratory dancing. We would love to jam with our friends so bring your instruments and singing voices to the reception and let the good times roll.</p>
                    <p>Music stops at the venue around 7, and then folks will be cleaning up till about 8 (if you want to stick around).  We figured ending a little early would give people time to get ready for the next day, the ability to party elsewhere or you may have other Memorial Day plans to attend to.</p>
                    <p>Can't make it for the whole time? That's fine. Pop in when you can and we'll be happy to see you. Just let us know what parts you think you'll make it to so we can plan the food and such.</p>

                    <h2>Welcome to Boulder</h2>

                    <p>If you are from out of town and aren't able to stay with friends or family there are a couple of nice hotels around the area. It is a Holiday Weekend so keep that in mind when booking.</p>

                    <h3>Getting to Boulder from the Airport</h3>
                    <p>If you don't have someone that can pick you up from the airport the best ways to get into town are by bus or shuttle. <a href="http://www3.rtd-denver.com//schedules/getSchedule.action?runboardId=133&routeId=AB&routeType=9&direction=W-Bound&serviceType=3">The AB</a> leaves from the airport regularly and goes to the downtown bus station near pearl st.</p>
                    <p>There are two great shuttle options: the <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com/HowItWorks.aspx">Super Shuttle</a> and <a href="http://www.greenrideco.com/">Boulder Green Ride</a>.</p>

                    <h3>Hotels</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Most expensive: <a href="http://www.stjulien.com/">St. Julien Hotel and Spa</a></li>
                        <li>Middle of the Road: <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/denbo-boulder-marriott/">Boulder Marriot</a></li>
                        <li>Least Expensive and Green: <a href="http://www.boulderoutlook.com/">The Boulder Outlook Hotel</a></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Things to Do in Boulder</h3>
                    <p>The weekend of our wedding is also the weekend of the <a href="http://www.bceproductions.com/boulder-creek-festival/">Boulder Creekfest</a>. The festival is host to performances and live music, tasty street food, a carnival, and lots of lovely local vendors. Access to the festival is free.</p>
                    <p>Also Sam will be performing with her Belly Dance troupe, the Tribal Misfits, on Saturday the 25th at 2:00.</p>
                    <p>A Boulder Landmark the <a href="http://www.boulderdowntown.com/">Pearl St walking mall</a> is home to fun stores, entertaining street performers, blooming flowers, and good restaurants. We especially recommend the <a href="http://thekitchencommunity.com/">Kitchen</a> and <a href="http://www.jaxboulder.com/">Jax</a>.</p>
                    <p>We are surrounded by the splendor of nature in Boulder. Take a hike in the foothills at ENCAR, Chataqua or Settler's Park. Bring plenty of water and be prepared for any kind of weather. A must while your in town. Also nearby is the Rocky Mountain National Park, outside Estes Park, which is only 45 minutes away</p>

                    <h2>FAQ</h2>

                    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>
                    <p>Mostly we want our friends and family to feel beautiful or handsome, and to be comfortable. We're not attached to much formality, but how often do you get to dress up in your best clothes? However, shorts and t-shirts might be a little too casual for our setting. We trust you to make the best choice.</p>

                    <h3>Who should you bring?</h3>
                    <p>Mostly we want your lovely selves at our wedding. We don't really want any strangers so if you happen to be one of our friends that is still seeking a date, we would prefer if our wedding wasn't one of them. As for the little ones, we don't mind having them around. There are plenty of fun things to see around the farm if they get bored with the formalities of an adult party. If your still not sure about someone just give us a call.</p>

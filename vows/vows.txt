East:

Right when we started dating (the first time), we bumped into each other at the bottom of the stairs in New Vista and you gave me the gentlest, most comfortably loving hug I'd ever had. I can still remember it vividly, and I admire and love your ability to love and to care so deeply. I vow to love you more deeply with each kiss and to give you the support to grow in the ways you desire.

South:

Your willingness to jump in and try new things never ceases to amaze me. Whether its dancing, climbing, yoga or any other exercise, you never hesitate to give it a shot. I vow to be open to new ways of expressing myself and my love for you, whether it be song, dance, or anything else we may find together and to find joy in your passion for change.

West:

I've never opened up to someone as wholly and comfortably as I have to you. I trust you completely, and I know that I can tell you anything without fear of judgement or overreaction. When I'm at my lowest, I can always trust you to be kind and understanding while getting me back on my feet. I vow to be that same safe place for you, and to always keep an open and loving heart for anything you need to say.

North:

I cannot express how much I appreciate and value your drive to constantly improve our lives. We might not always agree what paths to take, but we have always agreed on the direction. I vow to never stop improving, to never settle for less, and to encourage your individual growth as well as our growth together. My love for you will grow every day.
